express is a minimal and flexible node.js web app framework,
designed to make developing websites , web apps and APIs mush faster and easier


****************************

just copy the code from files and paste in app.js file and run using following command:
1) node app.js
2) nodemon app.js       ( nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. )
3) npm start            ( as we declare in the package.json file)

*********

I have added extra files assuming i am in app.js file, so take care if you run from different directory.
